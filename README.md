# BillingReminderService
This is an automatic emailing service I built for me and my roommates. This app updates a few times a month on unpaid bills.


## Structure
After giving the program access to a Google API Service account for Google Spreadsheets, I can access a shared spreadsheet using the *gspread* library for Python.

The data is retrieved from the spreadsheet and given to a variable that contains all the rows of the data that can be accessed.

I set a **`Patron`** (AKA anyone who is paying bills) class that reads, parses, and stratifies the data from the spreadsheet based on the tenet's name. The classes then act on that data and define a few structures that hold data about their bill statuses, i.e., their paid status, their due dates, bill amounts, etc.

A simple email body is then constructed based on the **`Patron's`** paid status for each bill.

## Notes
There is a lot of verbose code in this file, especially in the "Extracting Data" section of the get_gsinfo() method. This is because I was having trouble getting *gspread* to read the name of the index that was accessing the row data in a for-loop, so I opted to make the structure more clear for debugging purposes.Â
